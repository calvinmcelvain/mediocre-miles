# MediocreMiles

**MediocreMiles** is a Python-based application using [Strava's API](https://developers.strava.com/) designed to analyze and visualize individual running data. The goal is to provide accessible insights and predictive analysis for personal running performanceâ€”without requiring professional-level athleticism or expertise.

## :round_pushpin: Current Status & Roadmap

### Completed

- [X] Strava API integration.
- [X] Activity data fetching and storage.
- [X] Basic CSV export functionality.

### In Progress

- [ ] Visual analytics: pace trends, HR trends, distance over time, elevation profiles.
- [ ] Predictive models for future performance metrics.
- [ ] Route-based breakdowns and geospatial insights.

### Future Plans: Workout Parser

The next major feature will focus on intelligent workout parsing:
- Integration with LLMs to parse unstructured workout data.
- Move beyond fixed-interval workout tracking limitations.
- Develop smarter analysis using both statistical methods and AI.
